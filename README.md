# Recommender System
This repo will be dedicated to creating a recommender system for the smaller [Movielens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) they recommend for education and development. All files are added in the repo. 

## Good resources
Here are two good articles to get started. (If you find any other that are usable, please post them in the list too)
 - [Introduction to recommender system (Part 1)](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-recommender-system-part-1-collaborative-filtering-singular-value-decomposition-44c9659c5e75)
 - [Recommender system in keras](https://nipunbatra.github.io/blog/2017/recommend-keras.html)


## Task
The task here is to create the best recomender system with regards to __RMSE error__ for rating regression on the test set. Please use a train-test split of 80-20 for making the comparison fair. (I might create a dedicated training set and a not-so-secret testing set which we will use to evaluate your model when you feel that it is ready. Ill add this to the repo if i come around to do it.)

## Workflow
Please create a branch on which you create a folder with your name to store all relevant files for your submission. When you feel ready to compare your results, create a pull request to merge your branch with the master branch.
